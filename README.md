Web Environment with Gulp 4 

# gulp-Kit-2019
 This was built for new web developers or developers who want to try gulp instead of webpack. With these files you will be able to focus on the code and less time on configuring your environment.
 Below is a step by step entry to get started with the Gulp-Kit-2019.
 
 ## Steps
**Download or Clone Repo** - At the top of this page in a green tab click to clone or download


**Install Node** - https://nodejs.org/en/


**Download A Text Editor** - Download a Text Editor like VScode, Atom, or Sublime


**Install the node Packages** - On the root of your project run this on your terminal 
(yarn is perfectly fine as well)


```
npm install
```

**Update the node packages(this step is not needed with gulp 4)** - On the root of this project run this on your terminal 
(yarn is perfectly fine as well)

```
npm update
```

**Start the Server** - When you are ready to start coding just run this on your terminal 
(yarn is perfectly fine as well)

```
gulp watch
```


**Development** - When project is done on root of project in the terminal just run this and everything will 
move to a Dist. folder with optimized images, HTML, CSS, JS files.

```
gulp build:prod
```

Hope you enjoy this Web-Kit and Happy Coding everyone!
